ToDo / unsorted list of ideas for coming development:
	Functions:
		Support for editing of BLOBs in record editor (save to sdCard / load from sdCard)
		Configurable CSV import / export
		Build in root access to system databases (from aShell and experimental)
		Viewing and editing using forms and a kind of form generator / editor
		Progress with info during restore of databases based on comments in the file
			user thread to run script
		Progress indicator during queries (run in thread)
		Progress indicator during CSV imprt / export
		Create view wizards
		Scripts editor?
			or use of external editor to edit scripts
		Real integration with DropBox
			https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/sdk
		Real integration with Google Drive
		Encryption of databases
			https://guardianproject.info/code/sqlcipher/
		Searching
		Alter table wizard (simple as SQLite only support rename and add field)
	UI:
		Select where to save export / dump
		Select file to restore / load
		A "edit next record" from record editor
		Compress SQL wines.name -> t1.name in resulting SQL not on lists
		"Tab" view / show active tab
		Add a tablet layout

Done:
	Support for editing of BLOBs in record editor
	CSV import / export
	A filter builder
	Remember last directory when opening databases and SQL files
	Default values also works from the record editor when the field is NOT NULL
	Better handling of views with with instead of insert, update and delete
		triggers
	Special table names now works with the record editor during updates and insert
	Trigger and index definitions now exported when table dumped and database
		exported
	Now also wrapping of long texts in queries
	In record editor move table name above edit field
	In record editor ignore back button or ask if data should be discarded
	In data grid make add a max width to the fields
	Delete field in Create table wizard
	Sort data in table viewer by clicking on title
	When creating new database: select path with file browser!
	A tip pop up window to show information at different places in the
		program must include a do not show again at message level 
	Create Table wizards
	Recent database files
	Data entry and editing form use editing button at each row
	Execute scripts (single line or full script)
	Select SQL history from query form
	More functions (and stability) in query builder
	  Select from
	  Create View
	  Create Table
	  Drop
	  Delete from
	Create new database
	Paging large data sets
	Configuration
		Number of records to display
	Query mode
		Query builder
