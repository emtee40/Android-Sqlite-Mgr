Working / thinking on:

ToDo / unsorted list of ideas for coming development:
	Scripts editor?
		Use of external editor to edit scripts
	Progress indicator during queries
	Real integration with DropBox
		https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/sdk
	Encryption of databases
		https://guardianproject.info/code/sqlcipher/
	Build in root access to system databases (from aShell and experimental)
	Searching
	Select where to save export / dump
	Select file to restore / load
	Create view wizards
	Alter table wizard (simple as SQLite only support rename and add field)
	Compress SQL wines.name -> t1.name in resulting SQL not on lists
	"Tab" view / show active tab
	Save / Load multiple Queries in / from a file

Done:
	Delete field in Create table wizard
	Sort data in table viewer by clicking on title
	When creating new database: select path with file browser!
	A tip pop up window to show information at different places in the
		program must include a do not show again at message level 
	Create Table wizards
	Recent database files
	Data entry and editing form use editing button at each row
	Execute scripts (single line or full script)
	Select SQL history from query form
	More functions (and stability) in query builder
	  Select from
	  Create View
	  Create Table
	  Drop
	  Delete from
	Create new database
	Paging large data sets
	Configuration
		Number of records to display
	Query mode
		Query builder
	Save SQL - must be bound to the database by name of database or in database
	See index
	Primary index on SQL in aSQLiteManager to avoid duplicate SQL
	Change in orientation with open dialogues must be taken care of
